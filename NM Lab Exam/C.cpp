/*
C. Write a generalized computer oriented algorithmic flowchart and 
corresponding c/c++ program to solve the system of linear equations 
(atleast 10 equations) using Gauss Elemination method. Hence evaluate

10x₁ - x₂ = 100
-x₁ +15x₂ - x3 = 130
-x₂ + 20x3 - x4 = 162
-x3 + 25x4 - x5 = 184
-x4 + 30x5 = 202

print the solution up to 5 decimal places (write the corresponding output structure).
